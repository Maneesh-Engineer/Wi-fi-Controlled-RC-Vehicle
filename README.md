# Wi-fi-Controlled-RC-Vehicle

This is a project that combines electronics, programming, and mechanics to create a remotely operated car. It utilizes an Arduino board as the brain, which communicates with a Wi-Fi module (like ESP8266 or ESP32) to receive control commands from a smartphone or computer. These commands are then translated into actions for the car's motors, allowing users to steer, accelerate, and brake the vehicle wirelessly. This project involves components like motors, motor drivers, batteries, and a suitable chassis.


Characteristics :

Line Follower - THis car has been been modified in to a line following rc car.


Components :

1. Arduino Board: The microcontroller that controls the vehicle's functions.
2. Wi-Fi Module: Enables wireless communication between the vehicle and the controlling device.
3. Motor Driver: Controls the speed and direction of the vehicle's motors.
4. Motors: Provide the power to move the vehicle.
5. Chassis: The vehicle's frame.
6. Wheels: Provide traction.
7. Battery: Powers the entire system.


Other Sensor and Features used :

1. Line sensors: Detect the line for autonomous navigation.
2. Power regulator: To ensure stable voltage supply to components.
3. Breadboard: For prototyping and testing circuits.
4. Jumper wires: For connecting components.
5. Resistors and capacitors: For various circuit functions.
6. Buzzer or LED: For optional audio or visual feedback.


Software Components:

1. Arduino IDE: For programming the microcontroller.
2. Wi-Fi library: For handling wireless communication.
3. Motor control library: For controlling motor drivers.


Conclusion :

This work has seamlessly integrated the capabilities of line following and Wi-Fi control in one robotic platform, proving a great potential for the development of versatile, resourceful, and autonomous intelligent systems. The project is done in such a way that it presents the same robot that, on one hand, could be autonomously navigating using line sensors, and on the other hand, can be controlled remotely over a Wi-Fi network. While challenges were encountered in developing this, from sensor calibration to the tuning of the motors, these were dealt with effectively. 

#The result is a system that has the potential to be improved with advanced features like obstacle avoidance, speed control, and image processing.

This project laid the base for even more advanced robotics applications and valuable experience in embedded systems, control theory, and wireless communication.
